    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Tunnel of Fudge Cake first came onto the scene in the mid-1960s when Ella Rita Helfrich entered the cake in the 1966 Pillsbury Bake-Off Contest and managed to snag second place (first place that year went to Golden Gate Snack Bread). The Tunnel of Fudge Cake soared in popularity and helped to make Bundt pans ubiquitous.</p>
    <p>The original cake used fudge icing mix to make a gooey “tunnel” of fudge through the center. When Pillsbury discontinued the fudge icing Helfrich used, the brand developed a recipe that still made the fudgy interior, minus the fudge icing.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul><li>1 ½ cups milk</li>
        <li>1 (3.5 ounce) package non-instant chocolate pudding mix</li>
        <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1 ⅓ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>¾ cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>½ cup shortening</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, divided</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>2 cups chopped walnuts</li>
        <li>¾ cup confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons milk, or as needed</li>
     </ul>
     <h3>Directions</h3>
     <ol>
        <li>Make the filling: In a medium pan, combine 1 1/2 cups milk and pudding mix. Cook as directed on the package. Add chocolate chips and stir until melted. Set aside</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10-inch Bundt or tube pan.</li>
        <li>Make the cake batter: In a large bowl, combine white sugar, butter, and shortening. Beat until light and fluffy. Add vanilla and eggs. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Add flour, 1/2 cup cocoa, baking powder, salt, and 1 cup milk to a bowl. Beat on low speed until moistened. Beat on medium speed for 3 minutes, then stir in walnuts.</li>
        <li>Reserve 2 cups of the batter. Pour remaining batter into the prepared pan. Spoon the filling in a ring on top of the batter, making sure it does not touch the sides of the pan. Spoon reserved batter over the filling.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the cake springs back when touched lightly in the center, 50 to 60 minutes. Cool for 1 hour in the pan, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely.</li>
        <li>Make the glaze: In a small bowl, combine confectioners' sugar and remaining 1/4 cup cocoa. Stir in enough milk to reach desired drizzling consistency. Spoon glaze over the cooled cake, allowing some to run down the sides.</li>
     </ol>
